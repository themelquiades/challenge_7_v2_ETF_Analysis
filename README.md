# ETF Return Analysis
7th weekly challenge, analyzing a hypothetical equal-weighted fintech ETF by building a financial database and web application using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library.

As a first step, this analysis pulled in closing price and daily return data on one underlying stock held by the ETF (PYPL) to analyze its performance. 

It then focused on filtering and sorting performance data using SQL queries. 

Finally, the analysis pulled in closing price and daily return information on the 4 stocks held by the hypothetical ETF to calculate the ETF's annualized return and cumulative return from 12/16/16-12/4/20.

To turn the analysis into a web-based application, Voila was run in the termnial, resulting in the webpage shown below:
